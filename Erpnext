Basic Activities in a business
1. Buying
2. Selling

1. Buying:
It involves following transactions:

Material Request:

This is a request made by various departments within a company for the procurement of materials or items they need.
It initiates the procurement process and specifies the quantity and type of materials required.
Material Requests help streamline the purchasing process by providing a structured way for employees to request necessary items.

Request for Quotation (RFQ):

After receiving a Material Request, the company may issue an RFQ to multiple suppliers to request price quotations for the required materials.
An RFQ includes details about the items, quantities, and specifications needed.
Suppliers respond with their price quotations, which are then used to compare and select the best supplier.



Supplier Quotation:

This is the response from a supplier to the RFQ, providing the quoted prices, terms, and delivery conditions.
Supplier quotations allow the company to evaluate and compare offers from different suppliers.
The company can then select the most suitable supplier based on these quotations.

Price Confirmation:

Price confirmation is the formal acceptance of a supplier's quotation.
It signifies the company's intention to proceed with the purchase at the quoted price.
Once the price is confirmed, the purchasing process moves forward.

Purchase Order (PO):

A Purchase Order is a legally binding document sent by the buyer to the chosen supplier.
It specifies the final terms and conditions of the purchase, including the agreed-upon price, quantity, delivery date, and payment terms.
The PO serves as a contract between the buyer and the supplier.

Material Receipt:

After the supplier delivers the ordered materials, a Material Receipt is created to acknowledge the receipt of the goods.
It verifies that the items received match the items specified in the Purchase Order.
Material Receipts are essential for inventory management and accounting.

Purchase Invoice:

The supplier sends a Purchase Invoice to the buyer after delivering the goods or services.
It includes details of the transaction, such as the total amount due, taxes, and payment instructions.
The Purchase Invoice is used for accounting and payment processing.

Payment Entry:

Payment Entry is the recording of the payment made to the supplier for the received goods or services.
It updates the company's financial records and accounts payable.
Payment Entry ensures that the supplier is paid accurately and on time.

2. Selling:
It involves following transactions:

Quotation:

A Quotation is a formal document sent to a potential customer in response to their inquiry or request for pricing.
It includes details about the products or services being offered, their prices, and any terms and conditions.
The purpose of a quotation is to provide the customer with an estimate of the cost of their order.

Sales Order:

Once the customer accepts the quotation and decides to make a purchase, a Sales Order is created.
The Sales Order formalizes the customer's request to buy the specified products or services.
It includes details such as the quantity ordered, delivery date, and payment terms.

Delivery Note:

When the company is ready to ship or deliver the products to the customer, a Delivery Note is generated.
This document accompanies the shipment and lists the items being sent, their quantities, and any special instructions.
It serves as a packing slip and provides a record of what was delivered.


Sales Invoice:

After the products or services have been delivered, a Sales Invoice is sent to the customer.
It contains a summary of the products or services provided, their prices, and the total amount due.
The Sales Invoice serves as a formal request for payment and is used for accounting and record-keeping.

Payment Entry:

Payment Entry is the recording of the payment received from the customer for the invoice.
It updates the company's financial records, showing that the customer's account is settled.
Payment Entry ensures that the company's receivables are accurately tracked and managed.

Master
